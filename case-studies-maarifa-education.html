                        <h4>Project Description</h4>
                        <h5>Problem Statement</h5>
                        <p>
                            The client (Kenyatta University, Nairobi Kenya) had a challenge of monitoring lecture
                            attendance for students and lecturers as the norm could not meet their intention in
                            quick analysis of the data and providing accurate data. The client needed a software
                            system that could handle both monitoring of the data and fast way to evaluate the data
                            and post it in the students and lecturers portal. The main system specifications were
                            that it should be able to handle monitoring of the attendance even if the students have
                            a feature phone or no phone at all and should be fast i.e. it takes a maximum
                            of 2 minutes to ensure the attendance is captured so as not to disrupt the class for a
                            long time.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Key Steps</h5>
                        <p>
                            Having understood the clients need and the timelines involved towards testing and
                            delivering the system ( 1 semester == 3 months). I broke down the development of the
                            system into 4 main ares.<br>
                            <strong>i) The Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) application.</strong><br>
                            Through this application the students with feature phones would be able to mark
                            attendance and be logged in as present during the lecture. The ussd application was
                            developed in python and flask framework.<br>
                            <strong>ii) The mobile application</strong><br>
                            The mobile app, students with smart-phones were able to mark attendance and be logged in
                            as present during the lecturer. The mobile application was developed in Flutter for both
                            the android and IOS operating systems.<br>
                            <strong>iii) The Web application Portal</strong><br>
                            The web app portal allowed the administrators of the system to monitor how each class
                            being attended and get the analytics of both the lecturers and students average
                            attendance. It also provided an interface for scheduling and rescheduling of the classes
                            as it was among the features the clients had requested.<br>
                            <strong>iv) The IOT Device</strong><br>
                            The IOT device allowed for students who had a challenge of not having both a smart-phone
                            or a feature phone to be able to log into the class. Students fingerprints were captured
                            and stored in the database and while in class it was just a matter of confirmation of
                            the prints.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Deliverables</h5>
                        <p>
                            The application development was successful. I was able to test it with school of
                            medicine students and lecturers and got feedback on areas to improve before rolling it
                            out to the rest of the university for use. <a target="_blank"
                                                                          href="recommendation.jpg">Here</a> is a
                            recommendation I
                            received from the dean of the school advising the university management to onboard the
                            program into their system.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Key Learning Points</h5>
                        <p>
                            As this was a big challenge given the timelines involved, The major lesson I learned was
                            that it is important to view each client as a partner rather than another customer and
                            always have a constant communication to check whether you are meeting their needs.
                            Because of the good work I did for the client I was able to get another project from the
                            client. More details about it <a href="case_studies_timetable_generator.html">here.</a><br>

                            This project also posed a challenge to my leadership skills. With a team of 3 developers
                            I had to effectively manage their schedule to ensure there is not burnout and at the
                            same time get quality work from them. Breaking down the project really helped as each
                            developer understood their roles perfectly and the best part about this project is that
                            we delivered 3 week before the deadline and that allowed us to get feedback before
                            conducting the test.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                        <p>
                            Delivering quality work is important for self growth and business growth. As the
                            project manager for this project I have been able to steer it to reach even bigger audiences

                            representing

                            where universities across the continent expressed interest in joining the pilot phase. This
                            project is in its second phase as we are trying to implement machine learning and artificial
                            intelligence to the generation of the university timetable.
